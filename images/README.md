# Image Directory

This directory should contain any texture or image files needed by the ray tracer.

If your code references images like `earthmap.jpg`, they should be placed in this directory.

## Recommended Images

For the ray tracer to work with all examples, you might need these common texture images:

- `earthmap.jpg` - Earth texture map
- `perlin.jpg` - Perlin noise texture
- Any custom textures used in your scenes

## Finding Textures

If you don't have these files, you can find suitable free alternatives:

1. NASA Earth Textures: https://visibleearth.nasa.gov/images/73909/december-blue-marble-next-generation-w-topography-and-bathymetry
2. Free texture sites like textures.com
3. Generate Perlin noise textures with tools like GIMP or Photoshop

## Image Formats

The ray tracer supports common image formats like:

- JPEG (.jpg)
- PNG (.png)
- BMP (.bmp)

Place the files directly in this directory, not in subdirectories.
